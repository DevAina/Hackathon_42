	"The Walking Dead: Madagascar’s Zombies\n\
\nAncestor worship, magic, and superstition are omnipresent in Madagascar. Most Madagascans fear and revere the dead at the same time. Many believe that the souls of the deceased still live among them. These spirits of the ancestors, in Malagasy Lolo Vokatra, are able to see, guide, and protect families, friends and acquaintances, and even the entire community. However, unlike classic zombies such as those in the famous series The Walking Dead, they are not malevolent creatures. Although the Lolo Vokatra are the living dead, they are considered peaceful and harmless.\n\
\nBelief in the Lolo Vokatra differs in the different regions of Madagascar. In the southeast, it is believed that only people of certain descent rise from their graves. They then return to the living and lead an outwardly normal life. Only their complexion is said to be a little paler than that of the living. And sometimes they exude an unpleasant odour of decay. The living dead never return to the villages from which they originally came – for there they would be recognised and identified as dead. Instead, they look for new places of activity until, after many years, they are buried again as supposedly deceased. Some people in Madagascar are said to have lived up to seven times as a result.\n\
\nIn the south of the island, they are called Tanalasoa, good spirits. The Sakalava in the northwest, on the other hand, call the living dead Lolo ratsy, evil spirits. There are eyewitness reports from many villages in Madagascar of seeing the living dead. Some claim that they are simply doubles, a person very similar to the deceased. But the doppelgangers cannot be approached; they disappear as soon as a living person gets too close to them.\n\
\nSo the legend of the living dead remains alive in Madagascar. And in many places, people prefer to put a little more food and more rum in the tomb or grave. Who knows which relative will become the next Lolo vokatra?",
	"The little forest spirits – Kalanoro\n\
\nMany myths and legends surround the Kalanoro, the small forest spirits of Madagascar. The ethnic groups of the Betsimisaraka, the Sakalava, and the Bara are said to be early humans similar to the legendary Vazimba. The Tanala call them Fahasivy. Kalanoro is particularly small, not even one meter tall. Despite their small size, they are unusually strong. Kalanoro wear their long hair not only on their heads but all over their bodies. They give them great magical abilities. The Kalanoro’s eyes are said to glow red in the dark and look terribly grim. Their fingernails are long, their hands are curved, and there are said to be only three toes on their feet, pointing backward. This makes it very difficult to follow a Kalanoro trail: You always run after her in the wrong direction.\n\
\nEven today, the Kalanoro are said to live on Madagascar – hidden deep in the forest, safe from the prying eyes of man. But they are also said to live in caves, according to the Antankarana and the Tsimihety, spread all over the island. Only at night do they occasionally come to the villages. Here they take a pot of honey, there a prickly pear. Most of the year, however, the mystical beings live on the fruits of the forest and the sea. Sometimes they are said to be seen frolicking in rivers and lakes during the rainy season. They have a special connection with nature, plants, and animals, especially crocodiles, eels, and snakes. The Kalanoro are shy of people and rarely show their faces. However, they love the warmth of a fireplace in the cold dry season. And like to be tempted to stop by a lonely fireplace. To modern people, the mighty forest creatures are invisible. It is said that a Kalanoro only becomes visible when it has fingers or toes trapped and stuck under boulders.\n\
\nAmong many Malagasy, there is an idea that the Kalanoro lure children away from villages. In order to get the children back, the parents have to do certain things or offer them to the forest spirits, for example, rice or rum. What exactly it is about or what the parents have to do is requested from the Kalanoro with the help of a medium. The medium can be a man or a woman, into whom the spirit of the Kalanoro drives in, hidden by a cloth. In a high, childlike voice, the medium then speaks as the Kalanoro and conveys their demands. If the parents have complied with the Kalanoro’s wishes, they get their children back, usually in a cave. Several of these incidents are said to have occurred in the Andoboara cave in Ankarana National Park.\n\
\nAlso, a medium is needed if you want to make the forest spirits kind or apologize for the injury of a local fady. The Kalanoro can also help with infertility and the selection of appropriate medicinal herbs against diseases. Dogs are not allowed to be present during an invocation. They can see the forest spirits and keep them from showing themselves to people through the medium. For those who do not have a medium available, the Kalanoro can appear in dreams and give good advice. Some Betsileo believe that the Kalanoro steal infants and replace them with their own kind, or put curses on the children to stop their growth. Accordingly, people of small stature are often referred to as “children of the Kalanoro.”\n\
\nMany adventurers have claimed to have seen living Kalanoro. In 1889, members of the Royal Geographical Society London are said to have even captured a Kalanoro on Madagascar. However, if you search the archives of the society, you do not even find a note about it. It seems to be an urban legend. In 1924, American politician and adventurer Chase Salmon Osborn reported seeing a pair of Kalanoro having sex. He could not provide proof of his sighting.\n\
\nScientists suspect that the legend of the Kalanoro may have a very real origin. Extinct giant lemurs like Hadropithecus stenognathus, Archaeolemur majori, or Archaeolemur edwardsi could have been the model for the mysterious creatures. They lived on the ground and were much larger than today’s Indris. So these lemurs could well have been mistaken for very human creatures.",
	"Why the roots of the baobabs reach for the sky\n\
\nA Malagasy legend tells that there were times when the trees could still walk. At that time there was also a large lake whose water was so clear and calm that it lay there like a mirror.\n\
\nWhenever they passed the lake, the baobabs stopped. They became sad when they saw their own appearance reflected in the water. The other trees were slender and had smooth bark, they were rich in leaves and flowers. The baobabs, however, were wrinkled and bulbous and not at all handsome. Sad and angry they complained to their creator Zanahary, why only they had got such an ugly appearance. But Zanahary liked the baobabs just the way they were. He said: “Look, each of my creations is unique. It is the variety that makes you unique. And you are not the most beautiful, but you are the largest of all trees!” So the baobabs were content to have at least that characteristic. And so they continued to grow. Birds liked to nest in the branches, lemurs liked to rest in the shade of the thick trunks.\n\
\nBut the bigger they grew, the more the baobabs looked down on the many small bushes, trees, and animals. With time, the big baobabs imagined that they were something better. They admired their size in the water of the lake and made fun of the other creatures of God. Zanahary saw this and advised the baobabs to be less self-important. But the big trees ignored his advice.\n\
\nZanahary became angry. In his rage, he grabbed every single baobab, tore it out of the ground, and put it back in upside down. The baobabs could no longer see themselves in the water. They couldn’t look down on anyone either, because they were deep in the ground. Therefore they became small and humble in spirit, as they still are today. They take the place they can get and remain faithful to it for hundreds of years. And no baobab in the world has complained since. But their unique appearance “with their roots in the air”, that has remained.",
	"The graves of the Vazimba\n\
\nAn ancient legend says that the first people in Madagascar were the Vazimba. They came from far away in boats across the great sea to colonize the new land they called Madagascar. According to legend, they found their home in the Tsingys, the needle-sharp rocks of Bemaraha, in western Madagascar.\n\
\nTo reach the Tsingys, one still has to cross the Manambolo. The big river is mainly navigated in small wooden pirogues. There seems to be no life along steep cliff edges – and yet the cliffs of the Tsingys are silent witnesses of the times. For under a narrow rock overhang, only a few kilometers from the village of Bekopaka, Vazimba who died since time immemorial have been buried.\n\
\nEven today, the bones of dozens of people rest here. The coffins in which the Vazimba were buried have long since decayed. The skulls, arm, and leg bones are partly rubbed pearly white by the sand flying around. But fresh cloths, linen and rum bottles testify to the fact that even today Madagascans make pilgrimages to this burial place of their ancestors and ask for their blessing.\n\
\nForeigners are only allowed to visit the burial places by means of a pirogue when accompanied by certain villagers from Bekopaka. The selected villagers, descendants of the famous Vazimba, are believed to have a special connection to the ancestors. The visit follows a fixed, simple ceremonial. In a small Kabary, the Vazaha will be introduced to the ancestors. In addition, the Madagascans ask for the permission of the ancestors to visit the tombs. Not everyone is allowed to enter – accordingly great is the honor to be allowed to enter such a Malagasy sanctuary and to breathe real history.",
	"Why the largest lemur in the world is called Babakoto\n\
\nOnce upon a time in a small village in Madagascar, a Bezanozano man (a tribe living in the east of the country) prepared a small basket. He asked his little son Koto to come with him and together they wandered deep into the jungle to find honey. After a few hours they found a bee hive on a high rosewood tree. Father climbed the tree. When he was on top, he helped his son Koto climb up as well. Together, they excitedly reached the beeds and collected the tasty wild honey.\n\
\nSuddenly it started to rain. “Let us quickly get down from the tree again and be careful,” his father shouted before he slipped and fell into the depths himself. The father couldn’t survive the fall. Who should now help young Koto to climb down the tree? As if his situation had not been tragic enough, it began to rain more and more. A storm was brewing and thunderstorms were looming. oor Koto still sat on his tree, covered in leaves, trying to seek shelter from the rain. The thunderstorm lasted the whole night, and Koto fell asleep tired and exhausted.\n\
\nEarly in the morning Koto was woken up by a loud noise – it sounded as if someone was crying loudly in the distance. Koto got scared and began to cry, too. Fearfully, Koto looked around to see if anything could be seen around him. Then he saw a shadow in the thicket, jumping from tree to tree. And the shadow came in his direction… Koto desperately tried to get down from the tree, but he had no chance. Gathering all his courage, he shouted out loudly: “Go away, evil spirit! Go away, evil spirit!” – but the shadow did not react and got closer and closer. Koto decided to accept his inevitable fate and waited – eyes closed – for the bad spirit to take him.\n\
\nBut nothing happened. After some time, Koto became curious and opened his eyes.  In front of him, there sat an animal with black and white, dense fur. It was as big as a five-year-old child with a face like that of a dog. Koto rubbed his eyes in confusion and took a closer look.  The animal had five fingers on each hand, just like a human! Carefully, the creature took Koto on his back and jumped with him from branch to branch and from tree to tree, deeper and deeper, until both had almost certainly reached the ground.\n\
\nMeanwhile, some men from the village had started looking for the missing father and his son. One of the men discovered Koto among the trees and shouted: “Look! There’s Koto, on the back of a strange animal!” The villagers ran to the tree on which the animal was sitting with Koto on his back. Surprised, they discovered that Koto’s dead father was under the same tree. The strange animal above them had adopted Koto and acted like a father to him. Since then the Madagascans have called the helpful being – it was an Indri – “Babakoto”, which means “Koto’s father”."
